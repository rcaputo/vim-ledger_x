                                           *ledger_x-reconciling* *LxReconcile* *lr*
Reconciling~

The LxReconcile command starts Ledger_X's interactive reconciler.  Ledger_X
maps <leader>lr to this command.

LxReconcile prompts for an account to reconcile.  The account will be passed
verbatim to the ledger-cli reporting program, so it can be anything that
program recognizes.

A location list will open containing all matching uncleared postings.

Interaction is done through the location list:

"g" will go to the posting in the ledger window.  If a fold is hiding the
posting, it will be opened.

Space will toggle the posting under the cursor, between "pending reconcile"
and not.  The toggled posting will be displayed and highlighted in the main
ledger window.

">" will commit pending actions, but it will only succeed if the amounts of
the pending actions are in balance.

"<" will close the location list.  Pending actions will be reverted.  Ledger_X
will require confirmation if any actions are pending.

Each group of postings committed with ">" will be assigned a distinct
reconciliation ID.  This can be used for tracing or charting cash flows or to
verify the integrity of a ledger after changes have been made.  LxUnReconcile
uses them to find matching postings.

For example, this register report is grouped by reconciliation ID.  Any group
with a nonzero balance is in error.

    ledger -f my.ledger --group-by "tag('rID')" register

                                       *ledger_x-unreconciling* *LxUnReconcile* *lu*
Unreconciling~

The LxUnReconcile command starts Ledger_X's interactive reconciler in
"un-reconcile" mode.  The cleared posting under the cursor and all the
postings cleared with it during LxReconcile will appear in the location list
window.  The same interactive keystokes used by LxReconcile will be available
to unclear the postings and remove their reconciliation ID metadata.

Syntax~

Ledger_X includes an experimental syntax highlighting that attempts to parse
the ledger file format more completely.  It will be activated automatically.

Installing~

Be sure to install Vim-Ledger first.  Ledger_X will not work without
Vim-Ledger installed.  Vim-Ledger is at https://github.com/ledger/vim-ledger

Ledger_X provides a number of files in subdirectories.  Place them into
corresponding directories in your vim 'runtimepath'.  Pathogen, Vundle, etc.
may make this easier to manage.

Caveats~

Reconciling and unreconciling may not match postings correctly with some
currency and unit conventions.  See gitlab issue 3.
